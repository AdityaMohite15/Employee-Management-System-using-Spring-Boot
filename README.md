# Employee-Management-System-using-Spring-Boot
Developed a RESTful Employee Management System using Spring Boot to perform CRUD operations on employee records.
Implemented APIs using Spring Web and Spring Data JPA, with MySQL for database integration.
Followed a layered architecture (Controller–Service–Repository) and handled exceptions effectively.
Tested and validated all endpoints using Postman, ensuring proper HTTP responses and data validation.
